## Power calculations for Aims 1 and 2 for the DIAB-Cog grant.

Calculations are performed using approach similar to that described in
Galecki, A., & Burzykowski, T. (2013). Linear mixed-effects models using R. 
A Step-by-Step Approach. Springer (see Section 20.5)

Programs were written by Mohammed Kabeto

* Programs `10-Aim1_Create_predm.sas` and `12-Aim1_powerCalcs.sas` are used to perform power calculations 
for Aim 1.
* Program `20-Aim2_powerCalcs.sas` is used to perform power calculations for Aim 2.
* Reports generated by these programs are stored in `./reports` subfolder.
